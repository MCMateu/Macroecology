## **About me**

As a PhD student, I am fascinated by the complex role that microbial interactions play in the structure and function of microbial communities. The significance of microbial interactions cannot be overstated, particularly in the context of debilitating conditions such as different types of cancer, Crohn's disease or cystic fibrosis. My ultimate goal is to contribute to the development of a theoretical framework for understanding the dynamics of the microbiome, enabling us to predict the efficacy of microbiome-based medical treatments.
